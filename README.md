# pyphash: extremely simple wrapper around `crypt(3)`

pyphash is a Python extension module that wraps the C library function
`crypt`, which performs passphrase hashing, in the simplest possible
fashion.  It exposes one function, named `crypt`, which works just
like the C `crypt` except that it is thread safe:


    >>> pyphash.crypt("swordfish", "$5e$z4x3Zlhs")
    '$5$z4x3Zlhs$g7JP4M7HZw5L25Xwklbd2nQ2rfjzVGFB1SJutFnmvK4'

You have to create settings strings yourself.

This module is not intended to be used by programs that actually need
to hash passphrasesâ€”if it were, it would at least also provide access
to `crypt_gensalt`.  Rather, its purpose is to be a test case for the
packaging toolchain for C extension modules.  Linux distributions are
changing how they provide the shared library that implements `crypt`,
and Python packaging must adapt.  See [manylinux bug
#305](https://github.com/pypa/manylinux/issues/305) for the gory details.

For thread safety, the module actually uses the reentrant variant of
`crypt` called `crypt_r`, and looks for it in `crypt.h` rather than
`unistd.h`.  It will fail to compile if this function or this header
is not available.
